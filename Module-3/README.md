# Automatically Generate a PDF and Send It by Email

You work for a company that sells second-hand cars. The management wants to receive a monthly summary of the vehicles sold. The company already has a web service that provides sales data at the end of each month, but the management desires a more easily readable format in the form of an email with an attached PDF.

## Objectives

1. **Summarize and Process Sales Data:**
   - Write a script that processes the sales data into different categories for analysis and summary generation.

2. **Generate a PDF using Python:**
   - Utilize Python libraries to generate a PDF document summarizing the sales data.
   - The PDF should include relevant statistics, charts, and any other necessary information.

3. **Automatically Send a PDF by Email:**
   - Develop a script that automatically sends the generated PDF via email.
   - The email should be sent to the management or specified recipients.
   - Ensure the PDF is attached correctly, and the email content is appropriately formatted.

## Implementation

To achieve the objectives, follow these steps:

1. Collect the sales data from the web service at the end of each month.
2. Write a Python script to process and categorize the sales data.
3. Utilize Python libraries (such as ReportLab or PyPDF2) to generate a PDF summarizing the sales data.
4. Implement an email-sending functionality within the script to automatically send the PDF.
5. Set up a scheduled task or a cron job to run the script at the end of each month.

## Usage

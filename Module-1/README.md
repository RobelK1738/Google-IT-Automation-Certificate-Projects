# Scale and Convert Images Using PIL

Your company is in the process of updating its website, and a design contractor has been hired to create new icon graphics for the site. Unfortunately, the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format - rotated 90° and too large. As you're unable to contact the designers and your deadline is approaching rapidly, you need to use Python to prepare these images for the website launch.

## Objectives

Using the Python Imaging Library (PIL), the script will perform the following operations on a batch of images:

1. **Open an Image:**
   - Read and load the image file using PIL.

2. **Rotate an Image:**
   - Rotate the image by 90° to correct the incorrect orientation.

3. **Resize an Image:**
   - Adjust the size of the image to an appropriate dimension for website usage.

4. **Save an Image in a Specific Format:**
   - Save the processed image in a specified format, such as JPEG or PNG, in a separate directory.

## Implementation

To achieve the objectives, follow these steps:

1. Gather all the images that need to be processed and place them in a designated directory.
2. Write a Python script that utilizes the PIL library to open, rotate, resize, and save the images.
3. Configure the script to specify the target format and output directory.
4. Run the script to process the images and save the modified versions in the specified format and directory.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Python Imaging Library (PIL)

## Usage

1. Place the images that need to be processed in the designated input directory.
2. Configure the script with the desired rotation angle and desired output dimensions.
3. Specify the target format for the processed images and the output directory.
4. Run the Python script to open, rotate, resize, and save the images in the desired format and directory.
5. Check the output directory for the processed images ready for website usage.

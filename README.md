# Google IT Automation with Python

This repository contains real-world scenarios in Qwiklabs that challenge you to use multiple skills at once.

## Description

In this course, you will learn how to automate real-world tasks using Python. The course covers various topics and skills that will enable you to solve practical problems.

### Extending Code's Capabilities with External Python Modules

You will explore how to use external Python modules to extend the capabilities of your code. The course will guide you in using the Python Image Library (PIL) to create and modify images. While the course provides examples of common tasks, you will be encouraged to refer to the module documentation to solve specific problems.

### Communicating with the Outside World

The course will teach you how to communicate with the world outside of your code. You will learn data serialization techniques to transform in-memory objects into messages that can be sent to other programs. Additionally, you will discover how to send email messages and interact with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by other programs.

### Capstone Project

At the end of the course, you will have the skills to analyze a problem and create a solution using Python. The final capstone project will present you with a customer's requirements, and it will be your task to develop a program that fulfills those needs.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Utilize external Python modules to extend code's capabilities.
- Use documentation to learn and apply new modules.
- Create and modify images using the Python Image Library (PIL).
- Serialize data and send messages to other programs.
- Interact with APIs and send requests to external services.
- Send email messages programmatically.
- Analyze real-world problems and develop Python solutions.

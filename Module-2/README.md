# Process Text Files with Python Dictionaries and Upload to Running Web Service

You are working at a company that sells second-hand cars. The company receives customer feedback in the form of text files (.txt). Your manager has assigned you the task of displaying these customer reviews on the company's website. To accomplish this, you need to write a script that converts the text files into Python dictionaries and uploads the data to the company's website, which is built using Django.

## Objectives

1. **Process Text Files:**
   - Utilize the Python `os` module to process a directory of text files.
   - Read and extract information from each text file.

2. **Manage Information with Python Dictionaries:**
   - Convert the extracted information from the text files into Python dictionaries.
   - Organize the data in a structured manner within the dictionaries.

3. **Upload Content to a Running Web Service:**
   - Use the Python `requests` module to interact with a running web service.
   - Employ basic operations such as GET and POST methods to upload the processed content to the web service.

## Implementation

To accomplish the objectives, follow these steps:

1. Set up a directory containing the customer feedback text files.
2. Write a Python script that utilizes the `os` module to process the text files within the directory.
3. Extract the relevant information from each text file and store it in Python dictionaries.
4. Utilize the `requests` module to communicate with the running web service built with Django.
5. Implement the necessary GET and POST methods to upload the processed content to the web service.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Django

## Usage

1. Place the customer feedback text files in the designated directory.
2. Configure the script to connect to the running web service, including the appropriate URL and authentication if necessary.
3. Run the Python script to process the text files, convert them into Python dictionaries, and upload the data to the web service.
4. Verify that the customer reviews are displayed correctly on the company's website.
